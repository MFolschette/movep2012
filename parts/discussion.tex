\section{Conclusion}

This work establishes the abstraction relationship between PH, which is more abstract and allows incomplete knowledge on cooperations, and Thomas' approach for qualitative BRN modeling.
This motivates the concretization of PH models into a set of compatible Thomas' models using abduction in order to benefit of the complementary advantages of these two formal frameworks and extract some global information about the influences between components.

As an extension of the presented work, we plan to explore new semantics of BRNs to be able to tackle influences currently represented by unsigned edges.
