\section{Implementation}\label{sec:examples}

The inference method described in this paper has been implemented as a tool named \texttt{ph2thomas}, as part of
\textsc{Pint}\footnote{Available at \url{http://process.hitting.free.fr}}, which gathers PH related
tools.
Our implementation mainly consists of ASP programs that are solved using Clingo\footnote{Available
at \url{http://potassco.sourceforge.net}}.

In the previous sections, we illustrate our results on a toy example considered as a very small network.
But our approach can also successfully handle large PH models of BRNs found in the literature
such as an ERBB receptor-regulated G1/S transition model from \cite{Sahin09} which contains 20
components, and a T-cells receptor model from \cite{Klamt06} which contains 40
components\footnote{Both models are available as examples distributed with \textsc{Pint}.}.
For each model, IG and parameters inferences are performed together in less than a second
on a standard desktop computer.
